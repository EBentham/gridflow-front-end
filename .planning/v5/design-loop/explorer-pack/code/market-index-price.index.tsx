/**
 * Elexon's market index price (`mid`): the pilot page (v0.4 P4-0), the
 * approved reference every dataset page copies. A series page in the full
 * DESIGN §5 frame: the price line in the main panel with its extremes
 * labelled and its runs below zero banded; a key of the latest half-hour and
 * the window's range, extremes and mean (`PriceKey`); the volume traded on
 * the same clock, with a table of the days, in the working panel
 * (`VolumePanel`); About in the side panel. The backend's default filter
 * keeps one provider, APXMIDP, and the page says so; tooltips name each
 * half-hour with the settlement period the rows carry.
